A static web page is one that displays all the stored information, but does not have a way for the user to interact with it or change the 
infomration displayed. This is in contrast to a dynamic page where the user typically has an input and page is updated based on each interaction.

In this case I created a page that conveys the idea of an informative page about "Charles Darwin". The user can only read the information displayed and "navigate" 
through the demo links, but all the information listed is the entire information as it is stored. 

Attributes such as: position, margin, padding, etc. can be of great use to create simple and useful layouts.
